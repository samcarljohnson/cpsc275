You will provide your solution to this lab editing the collection 
of functions in this source file.

INTEGER CODING RULES:
 
  Replace the "return" statement in each function with one
  or more lines of C code that implements the function. Your code 
  must conform to the following style:
 
  int Funct(arg1, arg2, ...) {
      /* brief description of how your implementation works */
      int var1 = Expr1;
      ...
      int varM = ExprM;

      varJ = ExprJ;
      ...
      varN = ExprN;
      return ExprR;
  }

  Each "Expr" is an expression using ONLY the following:
  1. Integer constants 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusive. You are
      not allowed to use big constants such as 0xffffffff.
  2. Function arguments and local variables (no global variables).
  3. Unary integer operations ! ~
  4. Binary integer operations & ^ | + << >>
    
  Some of the problems restrict the set of allowed operators even further.
  Each "Expr" may consist of multiple operators. You are not restricted to
  one operator per line.

  You are expressly forbidden to:
  1. Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch, etc.
  2. Define or use any macros.
  3. Define any additional functions in this file.
  4. Call any functions.
  5. Use any other operations, such as &&, ||, -, or ?:
  6. Use any form of casting.
  7. Use any data type other than int.  This implies that you
     cannot use arrays, structs, or unions.
 
  You may assume that your machine:
  1. Uses 32-bit representations of integers.
  2. Performs right shifts arithmetically.
  3. Has unpredictable behavior when shifting an integer by more
     than the word size.

AN EXAMPLE OF ACCEPTABLE CODING STYLE:
  /*
   * pow2plus1 - returns 2^x + 1, where 0 <= x <= 31
   */
  int pow2plus1(int x) {
     /* exploit ability of shifts to compute powers of 2 */
     return (1 << x) + 1;
  }

/* 
 * bitAnd - x&y using only ~ and | 
 *   Example: bitAnd(6, 5) = 4
 *   Legal ops: ~ |
 *   Max ops: 8
 *   Rating: 1
 */
int bitAnd(int x, int y) {
	int returned = ~(~x|~y);
  return returned;
}

/* 
 * getByte - Extract byte n from word x
 *   Bytes numbered from 0 (LSB) to 3 (MSB)
 *   Examples: getByte(0x12345678,1) = 0x56
 *   Legal ops: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
 *   Max ops: 6
 *   Rating: 2
 */
int getByte(int x, int n) {
  return 2;
}

/* 
 * logicalShift - shift x to the right by n, using a logical shift
 *   Can assume that 0 <= n <= 31
 *   Examples: logicalShift(0x87654321,4) = 0x08765432
 *   Legal ops: ~ & ^ | + << >>
 *   Max ops: 20
 *   Rating: 3 
 */
int logicalShift(int x, int n) {
  return 2;
}

/*
 * bitCount - returns count of number of 1's in word
 *   Examples: bitCount(5) = 2, bitCount(7) = 3
 *   Legal ops: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
 *   Max ops: 40
 *   Rating: 4
 */
int bitCount(int x) {
  return 2;
}

/* 
 * bang - Compute !x without using !
 *   Examples: bang(3) = 0, bang(0) = 1
 *   Legal ops: ~ & ^ | + << >>
 *   Max ops: 12
 *   Rating: 4
